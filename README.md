## How Tax is Calculated

The system uses a progressive tax bracket system based on 2025 IRS projections. Here's a step-by-step explanation with examples:

### 1. Determine Taxable Income
Taxable Income = Gross Income - Deductions

### 2. Apply Tax Brackets
For each bracket, tax is calculated on the portion of income that falls within that bracket.

#### Example 1: Single Filer

Assume a single filer with $75,000 taxable income:

| Bracket     | Rate | Calculation                  | Tax      |
|-------------|------|------------------------------|----------|
| $0-$11,600  | 10%  | 11,600 Ã— 10%                 | $1,160   |
| $11,601-$47,150 | 12% | (47,150 - 11,600) Ã— 12%   | $4,266   |
| $47,151-$75,000 | 22% | (75,000 - 47,150) Ã— 22%   | $6,127   |
| **Total Tax** |    |                              | **$11,553** |

#### Example 2: Married Filing Jointly

Assume a married couple filing jointly with $150,000 taxable income:

| Bracket     | Rate | Calculation                  | Tax      |
|-------------|------|------------------------------|----------|
| $0-$23,200  | 10%  | 23,200 Ã— 10%                 | $2,320   |
| $23,201-$94,300 | 12% | (94,300 - 23,200) Ã— 12%   | $8,532   |
| $94,301-$150,000 | 22% | (150,000 - 94,300) Ã— 22% | $12,254  |
| **Total Tax** |    |                              | **$23,106** |

### 3. Deduction Optimization
The ML model predicts whether itemizing deductions would be more beneficial than taking the standard deduction. This decision is based on:
- Mortgage interest
- Charitable donations
- Medical expenses (above 7.5% AGI threshold)

### 4. Final Tax Calculation
Tax Owed = Calculated Tax - Credits (if applicable)
